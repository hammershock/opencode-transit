## Issue and outcome

Closes #

<!-- In a few sentences, explain the observable outcome and why this change produces it. -->

## Scope and boundaries

<!-- Note important compatibility, security, migration, and deliberately unchanged behavior. -->

## Verification

<!-- List exact commands and results. Do not include secrets or private machine/account data. -->

### Platform coverage

<!-- Mac is the default acceptance controller. Explain why Windows/WSL2 or multi-device checks are required or optional; see docs/testing-workflow.md. Check only platforms actually tested. -->

- [ ] macOS Apple Silicon
- [ ] Windows WSL2 / Ubuntu x64
- [ ] Not applicable (documentation/templates only)

Not run or still requiring maintainer verification:

<!-- Separate required gaps from optional unrun platforms. Record explicit maintainer deferrals and remaining risk; Mac success is not Windows evidence. -->

## UI evidence

<!-- For a visible TUI change, attach sanitized before/after screenshots or a short recording. Otherwise write "Not applicable." -->
